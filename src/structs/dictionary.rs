//! # **Dictionary Module** - *Append-only String Dictionary for Categorical Arrays*
//!
//! Backs `CategoricalArray<T>`. Pairs the ordered list of unique strings with
//! an internal hashmap so interning runs in O(1) rather than O(n) linear scan.
//!
//! ## Ownership modes
//! `Dictionary<T>` is an enum mirroring how `Buffer<T>` distinguishes
//! standalone from shared storage:
//!
//! - `Owned(DictionaryInner<T>)`: the categorical owns its dictionary outright
//!   and is free to mutate it. This is the standalone path and the only path
//!   available without the `shared_dict` feature.
//! - `Shared(Arc<DictionaryInner<T>>)` *(feature: `shared_dict`)*: the
//!   categorical holds an immutable view of a dictionary held by a parent
//!   (`SuperTable`). All sibling batches in that parent point at the same Arc,
//!   so codes are mutually meaningful across the entire structure. Direct
//!   mutation returns `DictionaryError::Shared`; growth must go through the
//!   parent's `CategoryManager` so every sibling stays coherent.
//!
//! ## Append-only invariant
//! Once a string is interned and assigned a code, that mapping is permanent
//! in both modes: entries are never reordered, replaced, or removed. A
//! dictionary that is a prefix of another agrees on every code they share,
//! which is what makes `Shared` rebinding cheap when the manager grows the
//! store: the old codes remain valid against the new Arc.
//!
//! ## Generic over T
//! `T` is the index width of the owning `CategoricalArray<T>`. Codes are
//! assigned as `T` directly, capping cardinality at the width's limit
//! (256 for `u8`, etc.) and removing the cast ceremony at call-sites.
