## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-26
- Bumped `minarrow` dependency from 0.11.0 to 0.12.1

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-17

### Changed
- Bumped `minarrow` dependency from `0.10.1` to `0.11.0`.

### Removed
- Unused nightly feature gates (`allocator_api`, `slice_ptr_get`,
  `portable_simd`) from the crate root. The underlying allocator-aware types
  are re-exported from `minarrow`, so the gates are not required at this
  crate's call sites.
